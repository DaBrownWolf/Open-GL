# Open-GL
I implemented nearly every function from line 81 - 132 in interp.cpp. For shape.cpp., I implemented the draw functionalities, and the text, rectangle, and diamond constructors.
I was given pre made header files, and the cpp files had empty functions that I had to implement.

I did NOT implement the various other files you see here. They were included. They mostly do supplementary stuff like debugging.

I am fully aware that the requirements were to not use class projects, or to use code that was written by someone else, but I do not have many nonschool projects that specifically
focus on data structures and algorithms, and Scott Patterson said it would be okay.
